# N-1-Buster
Your job today is to eliminate all the costly, inefficient N+1 queries in the code snippets below. Download and write your code in the skeleton so you can test as you go. Make sure to run rails db:setup to get the database seeded for you. Read through the associations and methods for each example to understand what needs to be fetched, then decide whether .includes or .joins is a better fit for the situation and implement whichever you choose.
